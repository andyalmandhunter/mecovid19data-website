Dr. Nirav D. Shah states, in his briefings, that more hospitals have been reporting asset counts to the CDC, which is at least partially responsible for the increase in the number of available ventilators. Alternative ventilators are ventilators that are typically used in other parts of the hospital (e.g. surgery), which have recently been approved for use in treating COVID-19 patients.
