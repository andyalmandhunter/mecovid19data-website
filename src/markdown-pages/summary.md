# Introduction & Disclaimer

Publicly available visualizations of Maine COVID-19 data are very limited, so we built this webpage to surface more interactive visualizations to the public. This is a work in progress, and we will regularly update it. We are not epidemiologists or experts in public health, so we will not provide interpretations of the data. If you have questions about COVID-19, please rely on the experts, such as the [Maine CDC](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml) or [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html).

# Method for Sourcing Data

Data is sourced from the [Maine CDC](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml) where possible. The Maine CDC publicizes current snapshots of state and county-level case, death, hospitalization, and recovery data in tables on their website. They do not provide historical data. We began scraping their website on March 31, 2020, and data from then on will be from the Maine CDC.

The NY Times surfaced county-level case and death on [GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), and that data is used where data is not directly available from the Maine CDC. The dataset is based on reports from state and local health agencies. See the [NY Times US Visualizations Page](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) for lots of visualizations on a national level.

When NY Times Data is not available, which is currently only for historic case recovery data, it was manually pulled from the [Portland Press Herald's plot, “Growth of Maine COVID 19 Cases”](https://www.pressherald.com/2020/03/17/track-maines-coronavirus-cases-by-county/). The Press Herald states that the data is from the Maine CDC.
