# Details about the CDC Data 
(from the [Maine CDC](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml))

**Who is Included in the Data?**
Data are about individuals who claim residency in Maine regardless of what state they 
were tested in, or where they are currently living. For example, an individual who claims residency in Maine but lives 
in Florida will appear in this data even if they were living in Florida at the time of illness. County listings are by 
residence of patient, not location of the hospital or testing location.

**What is Included in Cumulative Confirmed Cases?**
This represents the number of persons tested with a positive test 
result from any approved lab. Deaths are counted both in Cumulative Confirmed Cases and Deaths. Hospitalizations are 
counted in the Cumulative Confirmed and may also be counted in Deaths or Recovered depending on the outcome of the 
individual.  The only categories that are mutually exclusive are Deaths and Recovered.

**What are Some Limitations?**
Confirmed data represent only those individuals with positive test results, which likely 
under-represents the true number of cases in Maine. For individuals not considered to be at high risk, medical providers 
are currently advised to diagnose COVID-19 based on symptoms. Those diagnoses are not reported. All data are preliminary 
and may change as Maine CDC investigates confirmed cases.
